Old project during undergraduate, probably in my third year.

A chatting application to provide a chatting romm through a MFC application using C++ socket.
The application is client/server based.

Currently, there is a project report in Chinese version, if you cannot read, bear with it!!!

Runnable applications are available as well, so test them out and use it in your daily life, celebrate!!!!
